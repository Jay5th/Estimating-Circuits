I'm working through the paper "Formalizing the presumption of independence", which can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06738

My goal with this project is to implement the ideas about estimating circuits that are discussed in the paper. I'll work on this readme to make it easier for people that are interested in helping. If you want to get a better idea of what I'm trying to do, I have a couple of examples that follow the "simple boolean circuit" example from Section 6 of the paper.
